# 💻 Waguthi Jane — Interactive Terminal Portfolio

Welcome to **[jaynii.me](https://jaynii.me)** — my **interactive terminal-style portfolio**!  
Instead of clicking through menus, you can explore my work by typing commands — just like in a real terminal.

---

## 🧠 Overview

**jaynii** is a fun, minimalist, and developer-focused portfolio project designed to look and feel like a **command-line interface (CLI)**.  
You can type commands like:
help
about
projects
contact

...and get instant responses rendered directly on the screen.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- ⚛️ React.js — component-driven interface  
- 💨 Tailwind CSS — fast, responsive styling  
- 🖥️ Custom terminal component for command input/output  

**Backend**
- 🟩 Node.js — handles logic, email/contact commands  
- 🌐 Express.js — backend API routes
